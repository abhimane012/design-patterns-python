# Creational Design Patterns

The following is a list of creational design patterns:

1. **Singleton**  
    Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

2. **Factory Method**  
    Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3. **Abstract Factory**  
    Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4. **Builder**  
    Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

5. **Prototype**  
    Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

6. **Object Pool**  
    Manages a pool of reusable objects to minimize the cost of object creation and destruction.
