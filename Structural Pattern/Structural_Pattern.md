# Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities. These patterns focus on how objects and classes can be combined to form larger structures while keeping the system flexible and efficient.

## Common Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter Pattern**  
    Converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

2. **Bridge Pattern**  
    Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

3. **Composite Pattern**  
    Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

4. **Decorator Pattern**  
    Adds new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.

5. **Facade Pattern**  
    Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, making it easier to use.

6. **Flyweight Pattern**  
    Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing objects.

7. **Proxy Pattern**  
    Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Benefits of Structural Patterns

- Promotes code reusability and flexibility.
- Simplifies the design of complex systems.
- Enhances maintainability by reducing coupling between components.

## How to Use

1. Identify the relationships between classes and objects in your system.
2. Choose the appropriate structural pattern based on the problem you are solving.
3. Implement the pattern to improve the design and maintainability of your code.
